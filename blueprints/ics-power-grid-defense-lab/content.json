Your network security operations team is responsible for defending a regional electric power grid's control systems from a sophisticated cyber attack.\n\nThis environment simulates a full Purdue Model (IEC 62443) architecture with real ICS protocols (Modbus TCP, EtherNet/IP, OPC UA) across 7 network zones. You must detect and respond to a full IT-to-OT kill chain targeting power generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.\n\n## Network Architecture\n\n```\nL5 Internet     L4 Enterprise       L3.5 IT/OT DMZ      L3 Operations     L2 Supervisory    L1/L0 Process Control\n172.16.0.0/24   172.16.1.0/24       172.16.2.0/24        172.16.3.0/24     172.16.4.0/24     172.16.5.0/24\n\n[attacker]      [dc01]              [jump-host]          [historian]       [hmi-sub]         [plc-sub-a] Modbus\n  .0.10    -->  [mail-srv]     -->  [hist-mirror]   -->  [eng-ws-ot]  -->  [hmi-gen]    -->  [plc-sub-b] Modbus\n             [ent-firewall]         [ot-firewall]                         [hmi-grid]        [plc-gen]   EtherNet/IP\n                [eng-ws]                                                                    [plc-load]  Modbus\n                [corp-web]                                                                  [plc-safety] OPC UA\n                                                                                            [rtu-dist]  Modbus\n```\n\nSOC Network (172.16.6.0/24): [ids-sensor] [siem] [soc-analyst]\n\n## Phase 1: Sensor Verification and OT Baseline\n\n### Verify IDS with ICS Rulesets\n\nOpen the **soc-analyst** desktop (via CYROID web console) and verify network connectivity to lab systems.\n\n```bash\n# Verify connectivity to IDS sensor and SIEM\nping -c 3 172.16.6.10\nping -c 3 172.16.6.20\n\n# Check HMI dashboards are responding\ncurl -s http://172.16.4.10:8080/api/health\ncurl -s http://172.16.4.20:8080/api/health\ncurl -s http://172.16.4.30:8080/api/health\n\n# Check historian is collecting data\ncurl -s http://172.16.3.10:8080/api/plcs\n```\n\n### Verify OT Protocol Baselines\n\nVerify ICS protocol traffic is flowing by querying the HMI dashboards and historian:\n\n```bash\n# Check PLC data via HMI APIs\ncurl -s http://172.16.4.10:8080/api/data | python3 -m json.tool\ncurl -s http://172.16.4.20:8080/api/data | python3 -m json.tool\n\n# Check historian is recording data from all PLCs\ncurl -s http://172.16.3.10:8080/api/latest | python3 -m json.tool\n\n# Verify Modbus TCP connectivity to PLCs directly\npython3 -c \"from pymodbus.client import ModbusTcpClient; c=ModbusTcpClient('172.16.5.20'); c.connect(); print('plc-sub-b registers:', c.read_holding_registers(0,10).registers); c.close()\"\n```\n\n### Verify SIEM is Collecting OT Logs\n\nOpen the Wazuh dashboard and confirm both IT and OT endpoints are reporting.\n\n```\nURL: https://172.16.6.20:5601\nCredentials: admin / admin\nNavigate to: Wazuh > Agents\nVerify all 15 agents (IT + OT) are connected\n```\n\n### Start PCAP Captures\n\nStart packet captures on all mirrored OT networks:\n- IT/OT DMZ (172.16.2.0/24)\n- Supervisory / HMI (172.16.4.0/24)\n- Process Control (172.16.5.0/24)\n\n## Phase 2: Baseline Monitoring\n\n### Understand Normal OT Traffic Patterns\n\nObserve normal traffic for 10-15 minutes and document:\n\n**Modbus TCP (plc-sub-b at .5.20, plc-load at .5.40):**\n- Normal polling interval from HMIs (typically 1-5 second cycles)\n- Function codes seen: FC03 (Read Holding Registers), FC04 (Read Input Registers)\n- Register ranges being polled\n\n**Modbus TCP (plc-sub-a at .5.10, rtu-dist at .5.60):**\n- Normal polling intervals from historian and HMI-grid\n- Function codes seen: FC03 (Read Holding Registers)\n- Register ranges for protection relay and distribution status\n\n**EtherNet/IP (plc-gen at .5.30):**\n- Implicit messaging (I/O data) intervals\n- Explicit messaging (configuration) frequency\n- Connected vs unconnected messages\n\n**OPC UA (plc-safety at .5.50):**\n- Subscription update intervals\n- Normal node browse patterns\n- Authentication methods in use\n\n### Document Known-Good Communication Pairs\n\nRecord which hosts should be communicating with which PLCs:\n- HMIs to their respective PLCs (normal)\n- Historian polling all PLCs via operations network (normal)\n- Engineering workstation to PLCs only during maintenance windows (watch for off-hours)\n- NO direct IT network to PLC communication (always anomalous)\n\n## Phase 3: Detect IT Reconnaissance\n\n### Monitor for External Scanning\n\nWatch for port scanning against the enterprise perimeter.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- `ET SCAN Nmap Scripting Engine User-Agent Detected`\n- SYN flood patterns against enterprise firewall\n- Source IP: 172.16.0.10 (attacker)\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Identify scanning source IP and targeted ports\n2. Submit attacker IP as IOC\n3. Note any ICS-related ports being probed from internet (502, 44818, 4840)\n4. MITRE ATT&CK: **T1046** (Network Service Scanning)\n\n## Phase 4: Detect Initial Access\n\n### Watch for Spearphishing\n\nThe attacker will target the control systems engineer via email.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- Malicious attachment indicators in SIEM\n- Reverse shell connection from eng-ws (172.16.1.30)\n- PowerShell execution on engineer workstation\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Identify the phishing email and payload\n2. Document the C2 callback IP\n3. Submit forensic finding with email headers and payload hash\n4. MITRE ATT&CK: **T1566.001** (Spearphishing Attachment), **T1059.001** (PowerShell)\n\n## Phase 5: Detect Credential Harvesting\n\n### Monitor for AD Enumeration\n\nThe attacker will harvest credentials and look for OT service accounts.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- Mimikatz-style credential dumping signatures\n- Unusual LDAP queries against dc01\n- SMB traffic anomalies\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Identify what credentials were compromised\n2. Flag any OT-specific service accounts (e.g., \"ot-engineer\", \"scada-admin\")\n3. Recommend disabling compromised accounts\n4. MITRE ATT&CK: **T1003.001** (LSASS Memory), **T1087.002** (Domain Account Discovery)\n\n## Phase 6: Detect IT-to-OT Pivot\n\n### CRITICAL: Watch the Jump Host\n\nThe IT/OT DMZ jump host is the most critical detection point. Any unauthorized access here means the attacker is crossing into OT.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- SSH login to jump-host (172.16.2.10) from engineer workstation\n- Credential reuse (same credentials seen in IT compromise)\n- Off-hours access to jump host\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Correlate the jump host login with the earlier IT compromise\n2. Verify if this is an authorized maintenance window\n3. Alert plant operations immediately\n4. Start a threat hunt for lateral movement into OT zones\n5. MITRE ATT&CK: **T1021.004** (SSH), **T0886** (Remote Services)\n\n## Phase 7: Detect OT Protocol Scanning\n\n### Watch for ICS Protocol Enumeration\n\nThe attacker will scan OT networks for industrial devices and protocols.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- `ET ICS Modbus TCP Function Code - Read Holding Registers` from non-HMI source\n- `ET SCAN EtherNet/IP List Identity Request`\n- `ET ICS OPC UA Discovery Service GetEndpoints`\n\n**Key Detection Rule:** Any ICS protocol traffic originating from the IT/OT DMZ network (172.16.2.0/24) is ALWAYS suspicious. PLCs should only communicate with their designated HMIs and the historian.\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Document all PLCs the attacker enumerated\n2. Record protocol and register/point information accessed\n3. Submit IOCs for all scanned device IPs\n4. MITRE ATT&CK for ICS: **T0846** (Remote System Discovery), **T0842** (Network Sniffing)\n\n## Phase 8: Detect HMI Manipulation\n\n### Monitor for Unauthorized HMI Access\n\nThe attacker will access HMI web interfaces to blind operators.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- Web login to HMI from non-supervisory IP\n- Display configuration changes\n- HMI access from IT/OT DMZ source\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Identify which HMIs were accessed\n2. Alert plant operators that displays may be compromised\n3. Advise operators to verify readings against local instruments\n4. MITRE ATT&CK for ICS: **T0831** (Manipulation of View)\n\n## Phase 9: Detect PLC Process Manipulation\n\n### CRITICAL: Watch for Unauthorized PLC Writes\n\nThis is the most dangerous phase. The attacker will write to PLC registers to disrupt the grid.\n\n**Modbus TCP Writes (plc-sub-b, plc-load):**\n- Function Code 06 (Write Single Register) or FC16 (Write Multiple Registers)\n- From an IP that is NOT the designated HMI\n- Changes to breaker control registers\n- Load shedding setpoint modifications\n\n**Modbus TCP Writes (plc-sub-a, rtu-dist):**\n- FC06/FC16 writes to protection relay registers\n- Disabling overcurrent protection settings\n- Disabling auto-reclosing configurations\n\n**EtherNet/IP Writes (plc-gen):**\n- CIP Write requests to turbine governor\n- Speed setpoint modifications\n- Excitation control changes\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Document every unauthorized write with source IP, target PLC, register/point, and value\n2. Alert plant operators immediately\n3. Recommend switching affected PLCs to local/manual control\n4. Capture full PCAP of the write transactions\n5. MITRE ATT&CK for ICS: **T0836** (Modify Parameter), **T0855** (Unauthorized Command Message)\n\n## Phase 10: Detect Safety System Bypass\n\n### CRITICAL: Monitor the SIS\n\nThe Safety Instrumented System is the last line of defense.\n\n**Expected Alerts:**\n- OPC UA write requests to plc-safety (172.16.5.50)\n- Modifications to safety-critical nodes (overspeed trip, generator protection)\n- Any connection to SIS from non-engineering workstation\n\n**Actions:**\n1. This is a HIGHEST PRIORITY alert - potential for physical equipment damage\n2. Immediately isolate the SIS network if possible\n3. Verify SIS integrity with plant operations\n4. If SIS was modified, initiate emergency controlled shutdown\n5. MITRE ATT&CK for ICS: **T0880** (Loss of Safety), **T0857** (System Firmware Modification)\n\n## Phase 11: Incident Response - OT-Specific Containment\n\n### Containment (OT-Aware)\n\n**CRITICAL: OT incident response differs from IT.** Do NOT simply isolate everything - this can cause dangerous uncontrolled shutdowns.\n\n1. **Coordinate with plant operators** before any network changes\n2. Block attacker access at OT firewall (172.16.2.253) - block jump-host to OT\n3. Switch affected PLCs to local/manual control mode\n4. Verify SIS integrity and reset if tampered\n5. Do NOT power cycle PLCs without operator coordination\n6. Preserve forensic evidence:\n   - Download PCAPs from all monitored networks\n   - Export SIEM logs for the incident timeline\n   - Capture PLC memory/register dumps if safe to do so\n   - Preserve historian data showing process deviations\n\n### Recovery\n\n1. Verify all PLC logic against known-good backups\n2. Reset modified register values to safe defaults\n3. Restore HMI displays to correct configurations\n4. Re-enable protection relays and safety systems\n5. Coordinate controlled process restart with operations\n6. Monitor closely for any residual attacker access\n\n### Incident Report\n\nDocument your findings:\n- Complete attack timeline (IT compromise through OT impact)\n- All IOCs identified (IPs, credentials, tools, protocols)\n- MITRE ATT&CK for ICS techniques observed\n- Which PLCs/HMIs were compromised\n- Process impact assessment (was grid stability affected?)\n- Recommended Purdue Model segmentation improvements\n- Lessons learned for IT/OT convergence security\n\n## Phase 12: Scoring Review\n\nCheck the scoreboard to evaluate your team's performance:\n- **IT Detection Rate**: Did you catch the phishing, credential theft, and lateral movement?\n- **OT Detection Rate**: Did you catch the protocol scanning, HMI manipulation, and PLC writes?\n- **Time to Detect IT-to-OT Pivot**: How quickly did you identify the jump host compromise?\n- **Time to Detect PLC Manipulation**: How quickly did you identify unauthorized ICS writes?\n- **SIS Protection**: Did you detect and prevent the safety system bypass?\n- **IOC Accuracy**: Were your IOC submissions correct?\n- **OT-Aware Response**: Did your containment avoid causing additional process disruption?\n- **Forensic Quality**: Were your findings complete with ICS-specific evidence?\n",
